We are pleased to offer you our new free lightweight plugin named Picker.

AGCircularPicker is helpful for creating a controller aimed to manage any calculated parameter. For example, it can be used as a countdown timer or for keeping the score in the game interface.

AGCircularPicker can be customized to meet your individual requirements. The developer can set the number of the controllers and their design by selecting a color, gradient and other similar parameters. In addition, it’s possible to specify the transition type for showing controllers on the screen.
